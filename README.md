# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: What is this chat frontend?
A: Our chat frontend is a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with an LLM that is exposed via a REST API for use by this application.

### Q: Which LLMs are supported?
A: We currently support integration with:
- OpenAI chat models, including vision (requires an API key),
- Mistral chat models (requires an API key),
- Google Gemini chat models (requires an API key),
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) frontended models running locally.

### Q: I am using an LLM that has a REST API that is not on the list. Will I be able to access it?
A: 
- If it is compatible with one of our supported APIs, then you should be able to just change, for example, the OpenAI URL to point to it. You would also need to manually add the model's names to the MongoDB.
- You can make a feature request to have it added.
- You can create your own implementation of `MessageAPI` in the server code.

### Q: I have models that are not on the list. How do I add them?
A: 
- You can update the file `backend/src/config/modelsConfig.json` and restart/rebuild the backend. It will perform an upsert on the database collection for models. Note: It will not delete any models. If you don't want an existing model to display, mark it as not available. Be sure to refresh your page to see the changes reflected.
- You can use [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) to edit the Mongo collection **models**. Be sure to refresh your page to see the changes reflected.

## Usage

### Q: Are chat conversations saved or logged?
A: Yes, conversations are saved within MongoDB.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The chat frontend isn't displaying properly, what should I do?
A: First, try refreshing the page. Clearing your browser cache or trying a different browser can also resolve display issues.

## Support

### Q: Where can I get help if I have an issue or question?
A: Open an issue on our GitHub repository if you encounter a bug or have a feature request.

### Q: Can I suggest a new feature for the chat frontend?
A: Absolutely! We welcome feedback and suggestions. Please use the 'Feature Request' template on our GitHub repository to submit your idea. Our development team will review it and consider it for future updates.
